# Motion playground
I use this project as a playground to bring together a selection of experiments on web animations and interactivity. I am collecting them here as a trace of my learning process on some of the most popular web animation code libraries.

I used GSAP, Matter, p5, Framer; as well as JavaScript native tools such as Intersection Observer API. The goal is to better understand the technical behaviour and creative posibilities of animation and interactivity web tools.

## Techs. & tools

- React
